Jahia 6.5 - Person

This module is dedicated to manage biographical information, such as those typically found on the
"management team" section of a corporate web site, but also within knowledge bases.
This module isn’t redundant with the Jahia User management one, designed to control authenticated Jahia
users’ information. Therefore and to avoid data duplication, the "Person" module should only be used for
non-authenticated/registered users and as a pure content container.
