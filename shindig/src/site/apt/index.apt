Jahia Apache Shindig Integration

* Testing

 You should be able to fully interact with the gadgets using the following URLs :

 - {{http://localhost:8080/modules/shindig/gadgets/files/container/sample1.html}}

 - {{http://localhost:8080/modules/shindig/gadgets/files/container/sample2.html}}

 - {{http://localhost:8080/modules/shindig/gadgets/files/container/sample3.html}}

 - {{http://localhost:8080/modules/shindig/gadgets/files/container/sample4.html}}

 - {{http://localhost:8080/modules/shindig/gadgets/files/container/sample5.html}}

 - {{http://localhost:8080/modules/shindig/gadgets/files/container/sample6.html}}

 - {{http://localhost:8080/modules/shindig/gadgets/files/container/sample7.html}}

 Important : some of these examples are no longer working, so don't worry if they won't work all of them. At the time
 of this writing, sample2 is missing a gadget, sample4 doesn't work because it cannot load a script dependency
