URL mapping management UI

  URL mappings can be assigned to content nodes in the Content Edit Engine (<SEO> tab) on a per-language basis.
  In this case it is possible to access same node via different URLs, depending on the current browsing language.

  Each mapping can be activated or deactivated and one of them can be set as the default one (per language).
  Using the language switcher in the Edit Engine one can assign URL mappings for other languages.
