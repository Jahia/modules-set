Jahia 6.5 - Twitter

 This module defines currently two components

    * TwitterSearch: displays, within a page, a simple search box that dynamically outputs the resulting twitter feed.
    The search object is not stored in the JCR, this is just a parameter passed on the fly to get a result.

    * TwitterFeed: Defines a search/query tag, which is stored in the JCR. The component thus permanently displays the
    resulting live Twitter Feed.
