Jahia 6.5

This module lets you build lists of frequently asked questions by adding a simple question / answer component to Jahia.
To build a simple FAQ, this component is sufficient in itself. If you want to build a relatively long FAQ, or
organize it into sections, you can put your comments in a list (with anchored view) and use a "summary" component.
