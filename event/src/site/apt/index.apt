Jahia 6.5

This module is designed to manage events (title, description, start date, end date, location, type of event).
Event types are defined in the definition and may be modified or replaced to use another “initializer” more
consistent with the needs of your project (external list, call for a list stored in the JCR .. .)
Adding registration functions to a given event can be achieved very easily by setting up a simple form, shown
in live mode, whose mission is to create sub-nodes to the event in question for each record, for example.
