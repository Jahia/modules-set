Jahia Crazy 6.5

This module defines an object of type “article” that is very structured and complete. It combines a title, an
introduction (both unique), and a set of paragraphs based on my module "main content". The purpose section
also defines the ability of each paragraph to add an insert (highlights or quote) that will fit within the text on the
right or left of it.
This module is a good example for integrators who wish to understand how module inheritance works and to
develop components themselves, extending or integrating other objects.
