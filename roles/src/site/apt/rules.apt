Roles/permissions related business rules

  Several rules are provided for an event-driven role/permission management in an automated way.
  The list of possible rule consequences (actions) can be found in the <<</templates/roles/rules.dsl>>>
  file, which contains rule consequences in JBoss Rules Domain Specific Language.

  Examples of those consequence usages in rules can be found in the <<</templates/roles/rules.drl>>> file
  in the same <<<roles>>> module.
