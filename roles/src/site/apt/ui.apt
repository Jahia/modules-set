!OBSOLETE! Roles/permissions management UI

  Roles and permissions can be created on the server and on a virtual-site level.
  This allows having global roles/permissions for the server and more flexible access control
  for each virtual site.

  Management UI can be accessed via <Jahia Administration> -> <Server Settings> -> <Manager server roles> menu for the server-level
  and via <Jahia Administration> -> <Site settings> -> <Manage site roles> for a per-site role/permission management.
  Management includes:

  * {{{creation} Role creation}} - role manager with the overview of available roles and the possibility to create new roles or modify existing.

  * {{{permissions} Granting permissions to roles}} - this screen allows selection of particular permissions for each available role.

  * {{{roles} Granting roles to principals}} - this panel allows granting/revoking of roles to users and groups.

* Role {creation}

  The overview panel provides simple actions for managing roles: create, rename, edit, delete etc.
