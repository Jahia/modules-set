Jahia Crazy Jane - Sitemap Module

 * In Which format is my sitemap available ?

 The sitemap rendering is done by templates as default we provide three types of sitemap, html, text, or xml (following
 standard from {{{http://www.sitemaps.org}sitemaps.org}}.

 * How to customize the sitemap ?

 The sitemap will list all sub element of the current node having the options jmix:sitemap.
 By default all objects of type jnt:page will have this options automatically activated by some rules. You can add
 your own rules for different types, or you can manually activate the option on a specific content.

 Here the rule for automatically assign the jmix:sitemap option to a newly created page.

+--------------------------------
rule "Add sitemap mixin to page"
    salience -10
    no-loop
    when
        A new node is created
            - it has the type jnt:page
    then
        Add the type jmix:sitemap
end
+---------------------------------

 * How do I submit my sitemap to search engines like Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft ?

 The submission of your sitemap can be done automatically by a background job in JAHIA. This job is define inside the sitemap module.

+------------------------------------
<bean id="sitemapCronTrigger" class="org.quartz.CronTrigger">
        <property name="name" value="SitemapCronTrigger"/>
        <!-- Will start the process at 4 a.m -->
        <property name="cronExpression" value="0 0 4 * * ?" />
    </bean>

    <bean id="sitemapJobDetail" class="org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.JobDetailBean">
        <!-- This job will call searchEnginesUrl+urlEncoded(sitesUrl+/sitemap.xml)-->
        <!-- As an example here it will call http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/ping?sitemap=http%3A%2F%2Ftata.mondomaine.com%2Fsitemap.xml -->
        <property name="jobClass" value="org.jahia.modules.sitemap.SitemapJob"/>
        <property name="jobDataAsMap">
            <map>
                <entry key="searchEngines">
                    <list>
                        <value>http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/ping?sitemap=</value>
                    </list>
                </entry>
                <entry key="sites">
                    <list>
                        <value>http://example.domain.com</value>
                    </list>
                </entry>
            </map>
        </property>
    </bean>
+------------------------------------

  This job is define in two parts first we have the trigger. The trigger is here to define at which time we want to execute
  the job. Here we use a cron expression to define the time of execution ( here 4 A.M every day of every year).

  The second part is the job by itself, where you can configure how many search engines you want to reach by specifying
  the url where to submit the sitemap.

  Then you have to list which domain you want to submit. Here we will submit the domain/sitemap.xml. To know how to bind
  your domain/sitemap.xml to your homepage look at the documentation about Apache HTTP Server in the war module.

  For each search engines you will have to follow their policy, for example on google they ask that for the first time you
  manually register you sitemap using their webmaster tools (to follow what happens and have feedback in your google
  environment).
