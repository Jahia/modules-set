This module is a code sample to demonstrate how to create a quick UI to allow editors to change the layout of a page without editing the css stylesheet.
To perform this, the module defines a bunch of fields corresponding to main css styles.
After user input, those styles are in-lined within the page and, due to CSS inheritance mechanism, will take the lead on style declared in the sheet.

This module has no pretention to be widely used in real web sites (at least as it is given, graphical results might be awful because users can override a lot of styles!).
We advice you to use it as a demonstrator to create your own layout component if you fell the need to give some control to users.
